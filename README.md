# calculator

This project is a simple web-based calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

Through this project, I developed skills in HTML for structuring the layout, CSS for styling and responsiveness, and JavaScript for handling button inputs and performing calculations.
